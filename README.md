# R project: Product segmentation using hierarchical clustering on Brewdog Data

## Aim of the project:

The aim of this project is to use hierarchical clustering to segment 199 varieties of Brewdog Beer. 

## Key tasks performed in the project:

1. Identifying missing values
2. Selecting correct method to handle missing values
3. Preparing data for clustering
4. Selecting the right number of clusters
5. Performing heirarchical clustering

## Use case of the project:

This segmentation can be used for defining marketing strategies, cluster wise analysis of beer sales.

Marketing strategies can be shaped. For instance, in this project 199 beers have been classified into 4 clusters. Suppose a customer walks in a Brewdog bar for the first time, then the customer can be offered taster one from each cluster. Based on selection, customer can be offered range of beers which fall into that cluster.

Sales performance can be analysed using cluster information. For instance, company can analyse which cluster is generating more sales. This will help in deciding allocation of more resorces towards such type of beer.

## List of packages used in the project:
1. mice
2. VIM
3. corrgram
4. cluster
5. NbClust
6. dplyr
